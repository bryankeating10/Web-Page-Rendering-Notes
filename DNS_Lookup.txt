DNS: Domain Name System
	- Browser needs to convert the human-readable domain name into an IP address
	- The IP address is what the browser uses to connect to the website's IP address
DNS opperates as a metaphorical phonebook for the internet
	- Asks a root DNS server
	- ASks a TLD server
	- Asks the authoritative DNS server
The browser then uses the IP to connect to the website
