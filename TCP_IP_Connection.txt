TCP/IP Connection

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
	- Ensures reliable, ordered, and error chekced delivery of data
	- Process:
		- A socked is opened between the server at the specified IP address and
		  80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
		- TCP Handshake is performed
		- Data is transmitted

IP: Internet Protocol
	- Handles addressing and routing of data packets

TCP/IP governs how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and recieved
between computers on a network. It's like the postal system where IP is the 
address on the envelope and TCP ensures the letter is written and recieved both 
in full and in the correct order
